# Malicious-URL-Predictor
### **Malicious URL Predictor in Data Science**  

A **Malicious URL Predictor** in **data science** involves using statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning techniques to classify URLs as **benign or malicious**. The goal is to analyze patterns and extract features from URLs to make predictions based on historical data.

## **Steps in Building a Malicious URL Predictor**  

### **1. Data Collection**  
- Public datasets (e.g., PhishTank, OpenPhish, Kaggle datasets).  
- Web scraping and network traffic logs.  
- API sources like VirusTotal or Google Safe Browsing.  

### **2. Data Preprocessing**  
- **Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful attributes from URLs.

## **3. Feature Extraction**  

### **A. Lexical Features (String-based)**
- URL Length  
- Number of special characters (`@`, `/`, `-`, `_`)  
- Count of subdomains  
- Presence of IP addresses instead of domain names  

### **B. Host-based Features**  
- Domain Age (WHOIS lookup)  
- Registrar Information  
- SSL Certificate Validity  

### **C. Content-based Features**  
- Presence of suspicious words ("login", "bank", "verify")  
- HTML & JavaScript anomalies (if webpage content is available)  

### **D. Network Features**  
- DNS & WHOIS lookup results  
- Blacklist status (e.g., Google Safe Browsing API)  
- HTTP response headers

## **4. Machine Learning Models**  
Several models can be trained using extracted features:  

### **Traditional ML Models**  
âœ… Logistic Regression  
âœ… Decision Trees / Random Forest  
âœ… Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
âœ… XGBoost  

### **Deep Learning Approaches**  
âœ… **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** â€“ Useful for sequence-based analysis.  
âœ… **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** â€“ Can analyze the sequence of characters in URLs.  
âœ… **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** â€“ Can detect patterns in raw URL strings.

## **5. Model Evaluation**  
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**  
- **Confusion Matrix** to analyze misclassification  
- **ROC Curve & AUC Score**  

---

## **6. Deployment & Real-time Prediction**  
- Flask or FastAPI-based **Web API** for real-time URL analysis.  
- **Integration with security systems** (e.g., email filtering, browser extension).  
- **Automated Threat Intelligence** (Updating models with new threat data).

### **Conclusion**  
Using data science and ML, a **Malicious URL Predictor** can help detect phishing attacks, malware, and cyber threats effectively. ðŸš€
